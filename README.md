## About

Colleen's Game is a fun game of Tic Tac Toe that users can play online. Users can switch between X and O to have a fun time playing.

## Planning Stories

The project was a great challenge to determine how to complete the game logic and make a fun user experience. I followed the suggested schedule and began with authentication and then moved on to the game logic. From there, the styling was completed.

### Technologies used

Javascript, jQuery and HTML were used to create the game logic and user facing experience. I utilized ajax requests with a preset API to same user and game data. Finally I used CSS for styling.

* jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
